Restaurants have been one of the top business that was impacted by negative reviews online.

A lot of restaurant visits are driven by the ratings of the restaurants. And this along with the reviews is a lot of information that the restaurants can leverage to improve the consumer experience and inturn the revenue. 

Hence i wanted to take a dig at it and identify at an individual cuisine level what consumers really like and hate, as these are the items that would encourage or discourage a consumer to make another visit to the restaurant again.

Started off the project with a little EDA to check how the restaurants are spread across states, cities, cuisines. Followed by the analysis on the reviews for Indian cuisine.

Also included a predictive model with features engineered from review, photo, user and checkin datasets to predict restaurant closure.
