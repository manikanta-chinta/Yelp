## Yelp_NLP

A lot of restaurant visits are driven by the ratings of the restaurants. And this along with the reviews is a lot of information that the restaurants can leverage to improve the consumer experience and inturn the revenue. 

Hence i wanted to take a dig at it and identify at an individual cuisine level what consumers really like and hate, as these the items that would encourage and discourage a consumer to make another visit to the restaurant agaiin respectively.

Started off the project with a little EDA to check how the restaurants are spread across states, cities, cuisines. Followed by the analysis on the reviews for Indian cuisine. Created a functional at the end to any cuisine and give the results.
